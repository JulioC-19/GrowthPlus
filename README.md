# Growth+

## About Growth +
Growth+ is a mobile application designed to target numeracy, 
the ability to understand and work with numbers, in francophone Africa. 
This project has been developed as a response to the lack of educational resources related to basic math skills. 

Our app is developed in Android Studio using Java as our programming language. We utilized Realm as our local database which allows offline use of the app.
